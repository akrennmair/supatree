# supatree

Multi-repo worktrees for a single cross-repo issue, each agent in a
[nono](https://nono.sh) sandbox.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/panamafrancis/supatree/cmd/supatree@latest
supatree init
```

Requires git, [zellij](https://zellij.dev), nono, and `gh` for pull requests.

`supatree` is for work that spans several repos at once. It is built on [workbench](https://github.com/panamafrancis/workbench)'s packages — supatree is workbench for multi-repo changes — but independent of it at runtime: either installs and runs without the other, and they share no file on disk. Think of a change to `terraform`, then `keystone-api`, then `admin-frontend`. It creates one worktree per repo under a shared root so a single agent can run at the top and see every repo, and it orchestrates per-repo PR creation.

## Model

- A **stack** is a git repo holding the repo selection (`supatree.yml`), an agent guide (`AGENTS.md`), and `scripts/`. Create one with `supatree scaffold`. It lives wherever you like — `~/supatree/stacks/` by default — and is self-describing: `supatree.yml` maps each member's alias to its git URL, so a teammate who clones the stack can use it as is.

  ```yaml
  members:
    keystone: git@github.com:fraud-zero/keystone.git
    admin-frontend: git@github.com:fraud-zero/admin-frontend.git
  deps:
    admin-frontend: [keystone]
  ```
- **Supatree owns its clones.** Each member is cloned once into supatree's repo cache, `~/supatree/repos/<host>/<owner>/<repo>/`, from the URL the stack gives, and every tree's worktree of it hangs off that clone. Supatree never uses a clone it did not make (your `~/code/…`, workbench's repos). A personal ssh alias (a second GitHub account) belongs in git's `url.<base>.insteadOf`, not in the shared spec.
- A **supatree** is a worktree of that stack repo at `~/supatree/trees/<name>/`, with each member repo checked out under `repos/<alias>/`. Its state (`meta.yml`, `agents.yml`, `info.md`, `board.md`, mailboxes) lives in `~/.local/state/supatree/trees/<name>/`, and the tree's `.supatree` is a link to it — so `.supatree/info.md` reads as it always did, and a sandbox can be given every tree's state without being given anything inside a tree. It is named with a city name, like workbench worktrees.
- Personal files a worktree needs but git does not track — a `.env` with credentials — are `copy_files`, set per repository in `~/.config/supatree/config.yml` and copied from the cache clone's checkout into every new worktree. Put the file in the cache clone once; every tree gets a copy. A listed file that is missing is a warning, never a prompt:

  ```yaml
  repos:
    github.com/fraud-zero/keystone:
      copy_files: [.env.local]
  ```
- A stack's `scripts/setup`, if present, runs once per new tree — after the members exist and `copy_files` has run, before any agent tab opens — with stdin closed, so it can never wait on a person; it gets `SUPATREE_NAME`, `SUPATREE_ROOT` and `SUPATREE_MEMBERS`, its output goes to `.supatree/setup.log`, and a failure is a warning on a tree that still works. `sync` adding a member later runs that member's `copy_files` but not `setup` again.
- Member branches are `st/<slug>/<alias>` (the slug starts as the city name; rename it before opening PRs). The stack worktree itself is on `st/<name>`.
- A **review tree** (`supatree review`) is the same thing pointed at someone else's work: each member is checked out at a pull request's head on a tree-local `review/<slug>/<alias>` branch, and the tree records the PRs rather than deriving them from the branch name. The authoring commands (`rename-branch`, `create_pr`, `create_prs`) refuse there — the branches belong to the PRs' authors — and `.supatree/info.md` carries review instructions instead. The `docs` MCP tool with `topic: review` explains how to review in one. A review tree finishes as `reviewed` rather than `done` — the author's merge is their milestone, not work you shipped, and `history` counts the two separately.
- **Review tooling.** `review_refresh` (MCP, or `supatree review refresh`) re-fetches the PR heads when an author pushes; `review_post` submits one batched review with inline comments anchored to the checked-out commit, and refuses if the head has moved since. Posting publishes in your name, so it requires the `outward` permission (off by default at every autonomy level). `supatree review fork` converts a review tree into an authoring one whose PRs target the authors' branches.
- Teardown (`supatree rm`, and `sync --prune`) deletes only the branch the tree itself created. A member left on some other branch — after a manual `gh pr checkout`, say — is reported and left alone, because the delete is `git branch -D`.
- Dependencies between repos (`deps:` in `supatree.yml`) drive creation order, the merge order shown in `.supatree/info.md`, and `create_prs` ordering.

```

**When an agent tab will not start:** `supatree doctor` checks zellij, git, nono and every configured model's nono profile, including each profile it extends. It also flags a stack whose `AGENTS.md` still carries an old copy of supatree's conventions, which now live in each tree's generated `.supatree/info.md`: `supatree stack upgrade <stack>` replaces an unedited copy and keeps what you added below it, and an edited copy is left for you to trim. Opening an agent or the PM checks its profile first and fails with nono's complaint; and an agent pane whose nono exits within a few seconds stays open on nono's output until you press enter (each launch is logged to `~/.local/state/supatree/logs/agent-exec.log`). After a nono upgrade, `nono outdated`, `nono list --installed` and `nono profile list` show what changed.

`rename-branch` renames every member or none: if a member fails, the renames already made are rolled back, so the tree's recorded slug never points at a name only some members are on. With `--push` the pushes run after every local rename has landed, and a push failure is reported per repo without undoing the rename.

## Sidebar

`supatree ls` (the sidebar in each supatree tab, and `supatree start`'s pane) is a TUI listing every supatree with its agents and member repos.

The PMs have a section of their own pinned at the very top, **Product Managers**, above a divider — one `◆ <name>` row per PM, with `●` while its tab is open and `✉N` for requests it has not read yet. It is there even before any supatree exists; `gg` then `enter` (or `P` from anywhere) opens or focuses the top PM. `p` adds a PM, `d` on a PM row removes one. A cold `supatree start` opens the top PM for you; attaching to a running session leaves you where you were.

Below it the supatrees are split in two: **WIP**, your own changes, and **Reviews**, the review trees `supatree review` (or `N` in the sidebar) made. Each heading appears once its section has a tree in it. A supatree you create with `n` (or a review tree with `N`) is listed straight away under its section, as `◌ <name>  creating…`, while its members are cloned and the stack's setup runs.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` (or `↓` / `↑`) | Move down/up (skips subheaders) |
| `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` | Half-page down/up |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to the first / last row |
| `}` / `{` (or `]` / `[`) | Jump to the next / previous supatree |
| `Space` | Fold/unfold the innermost section — the repositories list on a repo row, otherwise the supatree |
| `h` / `l` (or `←` / `→`) | Collapse / expand; `h` closes the repositories section first, then the supatree |
| `zM` / `zR` | Fold / unfold **every** supatree |
| `Enter` / `o` | Open the selected agent, a shell in the selected member repo, or the PM on a PM row |
| `a` | Add an agent to the selected supatree — on a member row, open that repo's agent |
| `p` | Add a PM |
| `n` | New supatree |
| `N` | New review tree |
| `s` | Sync the selected supatree |
| `d` | Delete the selected supatree — on an agent row, remove that agent and close its tab (not `main`, which goes with the tree); on a PM row, remove that PM |
| `D` | Open (or focus) the dashboard tab |
| `P` | Open (or focus) the top PM |
| `m` | Hand the selected row to the top PM |
| `r` | Refresh (forces a PR status fetch) |
| `?` | Keybinding reference, Zellij's default keys included (`j`/`k` scroll it, any other key closes it) |
| `q` | Quit (confirms in sidebar mode) |

The mouse works too: the wheel scrolls the list and a click selects a row. Wheel scrolling pans the view without moving the cursor, so you can read further down the list and it stays put — the view snaps back to the cursor as soon as you press a movement key. When the list is taller than the pane it scrolls to keep the cursor in view.

Pressing `n` prompts for a **name** (leave it blank to auto-generate a city name). If more than one stack is registered you first pick which stack from a list (`↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` to move, `enter` to select, `esc` to cancel), then the name. The name is checked as you type — a name that would be rejected (`feature-v1.1`, or one already taken by a supatree) shows the reason under the field and `enter` leaves the prompt open so you can fix it in place; the warning clears with the character that caused it. After creation the cursor lands on the new supatree so it scrolls into view. Pressing `N` is the same flow for a review tree, with a pull-request prompt between stack and name (URLs or `owner/repo#number`).

Each supatree's **repositories section starts folded**, so a long list of supatrees stays readable. Its header carries a coloured count per PR status instead (`◌1 ◉2 ✓1 ✕1 ·3` — draft, open, merged, closed, and members with no PR yet); the same summary moves up onto the supatree row when the whole supatree is folded. Unfold the section (`Space`, `l` or `enter` on the `repositories` row) to see the member rows, which show each repo's PR state and number in full (`◉ open #871`).

`S` creates a stack: it asks for a name, then runs `supatree stack new <name>` (its picker over the repo cache) in a tab of its own.

Folds are shared: they live in `~/.local/state/supatree/ui.yml` rather than in each sidebar process, so folding a supatree in one tab folds it in every other tab's sidebar on its next reload (focus or the 30s tick) instead of leaving each tab with its own shape of the same list.

The two sections answer different questions, so `enter` does different things in them. Agent rows are processes (the `●`/`○` dot is liveness), and `enter` opens or focuses that agent's tab. Member rows are places reporting state (branch, dirty mark, PR), so `enter` (or `o`) stands in one: a shell pane rooted at `repos/<alias>/`, opened beside the agent in the tab's main area rather than under the sidebar. That shell is your own — it is **not** inside the nono sandbox, unlike every agent workbench and supatree launch — and it is disposable, closing when you exit it. To get an agent scoped to a single member repo instead (nono allows only that repo, not the whole tree), press `a` on the member row; `a` on a supatree or agent row still prompts for a new root agent's name. The footer hint tracks the cursor (`enter shell` vs `enter open`) so you can see which you'll get. A member that isn't checked out yet says so and points at `supatree sync`.

Like the workbench sidebar, each supatree tab's sidebar marks the supatree that tab belongs to with a `▸` in the gutter ("you are here"), independent of the cursor. It re-reads live state when the pane regains focus and on its periodic tick, so newly created or removed supatrees appear across tabs without pressing `r`. PR status is fetched under the same quota discipline as the workbench sidebar — one conditional poll per repo (free when nothing changed), single-fetcher lock, no request for unpushed branches, and a persisted pause until the reset time a rate-limit response reports — so a churning or multi-tab sidebar doesn't drain the API quota. Both sidebars share the same code path (`github.Sync`).

## Status and dashboard

`supatree status` answers "where is everything?" across all supatrees at once. It derives each member repo's place in the ship lifecycle from local git plus the cached PR status:

```
absent → idle → wip → pushed → draft → open → changes | approved → merged | closed
```

and rolls that up per supatree — `setup` (a member worktree is missing), `new`, `wip`, `pushed`, `review`, `approved` (every open PR approved, ready to merge), or `done` (everything merged or closed, so the tree is only occupying disk — the cue to `supatree rm` it). Alongside the state it flags supatrees that are **blocked** (a PR has changes requested or failing checks), **dirty** (uncommitted work), and **stale** (no commit in any member for `--stale-after`, default 7 days).

```sh
supatree status              # human-readable, cache only — costs no GitHub quota
supatree status --refresh    # fetch PR status from GitHub first
supatree status --json       # the whole summary, for scripts and watch loops
supatree status --all        # include the members of finished supatrees
```

`supatree dash` is the same data as a full-screen TUI, meant to live in its own window or Zellij tab: one row per supatree with its state, open/total PRs, review verdicts (`2✓ 1✗ 3·` — approved, changes requested, waiting), time since the last commit, and what needs attention. `space` expands a supatree to its member repos with PR numbers and per-repo state; `enter` focuses that supatree's Zellij tab. The most actionable supatrees sort first (blocked, then ready to merge, then in review) and finished ones sink to the bottom.

Press `D` in the supatree sidebar to open or focus the dashboard in a `supatree-dash` tab, or run `supatree dash` in any terminal. Both the dashboard and the sidebar read the same on-disk PR cache and fetch under the same staleness gate, cross-process lock and rate-limit backoff, so running a dashboard alongside a screenful of sidebars adds no extra GitHub API load. Non-interactive (piped) output falls back to `supatree status`.

## Review comments

`supatree comments <tree> <repo>` shows what reviewers have said on a member repo's pull request: top-level comments, review verdicts, and line-anchored threads with their **resolved state**. Unresolved threads lead the output, because they are the only part still waiting on an answer; `--all` covers every member, `--json` is for scripts, `--force` re-fetches.

Unlike `supatree status`, this one costs API quota. Thread resolution exists only in GitHub's GraphQL API, so it is a second query shape per PR on top of the one the sidebar already spends. It is therefore fetched **only when asked for, never on a timer**, and cached until the PR itself changes — so asking twice about an unchanged PR is free. Agents get the same thing as the `pr_comments` MCP tool.

## The PM agent

`supatree pm` (or `P` in the sidebar) opens a standing agent rooted at `~/.local/state/supatree/pm` that can see every supatree at once: what is blocked, what reviewers said, who is working where. It is **optional** — nothing else depends on it running, and without it supatree behaves exactly as it does today.

It is not rooted in a supatree, because one that manages many cannot live inside one of them. That also means it gets its own MCP gate: `SUPATREE_PM=1` unlocks the cross-tree tools (`requests`, `list_trees`, `events`, `notify`), while `SUPATREE` stays *unset* so the tree-scoped tools stay hidden rather than resolving nothing.

**Its sandbox is a different shape, not a bigger one.** It allows its own home, every tree's state (one directory, so a tree created after the PM started needs no relaunch), the notification outbox and the stack repos — and nothing inside any tree. The invariant is not "read-only on trees" but *the PM may write supatree's own state and never a member repo's working tree*. Creating and removing trees writes exactly what it may not, so `new_tree` and `remove_tree` ask the watcher to do it and wait for the answer. Set `pm_model` in `~/.config/supatree/config.yml` to point it at a `models` entry with its own `nono_profile`: the PM executes no third-party code but reads text other people wrote and holds credentials that reach off the machine, so the profile it wants is narrow on egress rather than wide on the filesystem.

```yaml
# ~/.config/supatree/config.yml
pm_model: claude-pm     # a models entry whose nono_profile scopes the gh credential
```

**Reaching it.** Anything that can append to a file can queue a request — `supatree request`, the sidebar, the watcher — and the PM reads the queue at the top of each turn. That indirection is the point: a Go process cannot use a message bus, but every Go process can append a line. The queue is read from a **stored offset**, so a PM that has been closed for a day catches up on the backlog instead of losing it, and the offset is only committed after the requests have been handed over.

**Nudging it.** An idle PM takes no turn, so a new request can sit unread until you next talk to it. With `pm_nudge: true` (default: off), the watcher types a fixed line — "You have new requests. Call the `requests` tool and act on them." — into a running PM's prompt when a request arrives for it. A request never causes more than one nudge. It never types into a pane it cannot be sure is the PM. It types even while the PM's tab is the one on screen, since zellij cannot tell a tab you are reading from one left open in a terminal you are not looking at — which is why it is off by default: the line lands wherever the prompt is, including the middle of something you are typing there.

```yaml
# ~/.config/supatree/config.yml
pm_nudge: true
```

**Two rules it is given up front.** It never opens a Zellij tab unprompted — opening focuses the tab and yanks the terminal away from whoever is using it, so it creates trees and *reports*, and you press enter yourself. And it treats fetched text as data rather than instructions: a PR comment is written by anyone who can comment on the repository.

It also cannot notify you directly — nothing inside the sandbox can — so its `notify` tool queues through the watcher, which applies the same tiering and deduping as its own events.

**Several PMs.** `supatree pm new <name>` (or `p` in the sidebar) adds a PM below the others; `supatree pm rm <name>` (or `d`) removes one and closes its tab, and the last one cannot be removed. They all run in `~/.local/state/supatree/pm` with the same grants and base instructions, and each resumes its own conversation by session ID; the list lives in `~/.local/state/supatree/pms.yml`, top first, outside the PMs' home so no PM can rewrite it (`supatree doctor` flags a `pm/pms.yml` that reappears there). Requests are routed rather than shared: each PM reads the queue from its own offset and keeps what is addressed to it (`supatree request --to <name>`), and the **top** PM also takes everything addressed to nobody — the watcher, the scheduler, `m` — so two PMs never both act on one request. Tree agents reach the top PM as `pm` and any other as `pm-<name>`, through `message_agent`; the `agents` tool lists the PMs, from a roster (`~/.local/state/supatree/roster/pms.json`) republished on every registry change and granted to tree agents read-only, since the registry itself is not. The PM from before there were several stays as `pm`, with its old tab, address and conversation.

**The PM config repo.** A PM's home is runtime state, so nothing in it can be committed, shared or differ between PMs. What shapes them lives in a git repo you own instead, which every PM reads at launch and none can write:

```
AGENTS.md                 appended to every PM's instructions
.claude/                  skills, commands, settings.json, hooks — linked into the PMs' home
pms/<name>/AGENTS.md      instructions for the PM called <name> alone ("pm" is the default PM)
pms/<name>/settings.json  Claude settings for that PM alone (--settings)
```

`supatree pm config --init` creates one at `~/supatree/pm-config` — a README and an empty `pms/`, committed — and registers it; until you commit something to it, the PMs behave exactly as before. `supatree pm config <path | git-url>` registers an existing one instead (a URL is cloned to the same place). Either way it is refused anywhere an agent can write — the stacks, the trees, the repo cache, supatree's state — and checked again at every launch. Changes reach a PM when it is next opened; `supatree pm ls` flags a PM running an older commit. Adding `.claude/` takes over the PMs' home `.claude`; what stood there is moved aside to `.claude.moved-<time>`.

## Autonomy

What the PM may do unasked is explicit and per supatree, in `.supatree/meta.yml`, with a workspace default in `~/.config/supatree/config.yml`:

| Level | Unasked, the PM may | If you ask it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `off` | report only | report only |
| `nudge` *(default)* | message agents | create, reap, push |
| `auto` | create supatrees, open PRs, reap finished ones | as unasked |

**The level governs what the PM does unasked**, which is the only thing about it worth being careful over. Ask it to create a supatree and it creates one: the mutating tools take an `asked` flag, the PM sets it when the request came from you in that turn, and below `auto` that is the difference between doing the thing and reporting that it could. `off` is the exception — report-only means report-only, and asking does not lift it — and a scheduled turn cannot carry the flag at all, because there is nobody in one to have asked. It is the same assertion `remove_tree`'s `force` has always rested on, trusted the same way: autonomy is a consent boundary and the sandbox is the security one, and consent is exactly what an agent is in a position to report.

**Outward-facing actions are a separate axis** (`outward`, off everywhere by default). "Message a local agent" and "comment on a PR" are different kinds of risk — one is private and recoverable, the other is published and permanent — so wanting the PM to create supatrees unattended does not also grant it a public voice.

The workspace default is not just convenience: autonomy lives per tree, so without it nothing would govern `new_tree`, which has no tree yet to carry a level. **A scheduled turn caps at `nudge`** however the tree is configured, unless its schedule entry opts in — nobody is watching one of those.

## The board

`.supatree/board.md` is what the PM maintains per supatree: what each agent is on, what is blocked, what is waiting on you. Status must not mean "read the PM's chat log" — scrollback is a terrible status display and people stop reading it by day three. Chat is where you negotiate; the board is where you check. `b` in the dashboard shows the selected tree's board.

## Memory

Durable notes live in `notes/` **in the stack repo**, scaffolded by `supatree scaffold`. That is a deliberate choice over a vector store: at the volume this produces — tens to low hundreds of finished supatrees a year — grep beats embedding retrieval on precision and on being debuggable, and a git directory is diffable, blameable, reviewable and shared with the team. Curation arrives as a pull request rather than a migration.

Three tools: `remember` writes a note, `recall` searches them, and `history` answers what shipped from the event ledger. The split matters — **`history` is exact and `recall` is not**, so the PM is told never to answer a status question from memory. Git and the ledger are authoritative for facts; notes are for judgement.

Two things keep it from rotting. `info.md` names only the few most recent notes, with everything else behind `recall`: storage was never the hard problem, what loads into every session is. And every `recall` logs its query and whether it hit, so *"a store nothing has read in 30 days gets deleted, not debugged"* is a measurable claim rather than a hope.

`supatree rm` no longer throws away agent history either: transcripts are moved to `~/.local/state/supatree/archive/<tree>/` before the session cache is cleared. Archiving is deterministic and cheap, which is what makes it safe on the removal path — distilling one into something worth keeping is a judgement call, and blocking a removal on an agent round-trip would be worse than the leak.

## Scheduled work

`~/.config/supatree/schedule.yml` (`supatree schedule init` writes an example) runs recurring PM work: a morning standup, hourly triage of new review comments, a Friday reap proposal, or a one-shot reminder.

The scheduler lives in the **watcher**, not in the PM. An agent cannot be trusted to hold a timer — it is mid-turn, blocked on a tool call, or was restarted an hour ago — and a schedule that silently drops jobs is worse than none. Firing a job is an append to the same request queue the sidebar's `m` uses, so the PM needs no timer and no new channel.

```yaml
jobs:
  - id: standup
    at: "09:00"
    days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
    when: events_since_last     # the default: stay silent when nothing moved
    prompt: "Summarise what moved since yesterday."
```

Three rules do the real work. A job seen for the first time is **seeded, not fired** — otherwise writing the file fires every entry at once. A job that missed fifteen hourly windows overnight fires **once**, not fifteen times. And `when: events_since_last` is the default because a standup that reports "nothing changed" every morning is notification fatigue wearing a suit. Jobs read the cache and never fetch, so a timetable costs no API quota.

`supatree schedule run <id>` fires one now for testing, deliberately without touching the fire times.

## Talking between agents

Several agents can share a supatree, and they can now reach each other. Each is launched with a stable address — `st-<tree>-<agent>` — recorded in `.supatree/agents.yml` and passed to the CLI via the model's `agent_name_args` (`["--name", "{agent_name}"]` for claude). Without it every agent in a tree would derive its name from the shared tree root and they would all collide.

Three MCP tools: `agents` lists who is here with their addresses and unread counts, `message_agent` leaves one a message, and `inbox` reads and clears your own. All three take an optional `tree`, so the PM — which lives in no supatree — can use them by naming one; inside a supatree you can omit it and mean your own.

**Delivery is always by mailbox** — a file under `.supatree/mail/<agent>/`, read on the recipient's next turn. That is the contract, and it works for every model, whether or not the recipient is running. A message bus, where the CLI has one, only makes the same message arrive sooner; `agents` reports per agent whether it is reachable that way (`bus st-canberra-main`) or by mailbox alone (`mailbox (next turn)`), rather than implying parity.

```yaml
# ~/.config/supatree/config.yml — a model with no message bus simply omits this
models:
  claude:
    agent_name_args: ["--name", "{agent_name}"]
```

### Agents on other CLIs

A new agent can run on any entry in `models:`, and keeps that model on every
reopen:

- In the sidebar, `a` asks for the agent's name, then for its model, starting
  on the tree's own. Models whose binary is not on `PATH` are listed as not
  installed and cannot be picked. The picker is skipped when only one model is
  configured, and for an agent that already exists.
- `supatree open <tree> --agent <name> --model <key>` does the same from a
  shell.
- A PM's `start_agent` takes an optional `model`.

A tree's main agent always runs on the tree's model. Asking for another model
for an agent that already exists is refused: its session belongs to the CLI
it was started on.

Each agent row in the sidebar shows its model's `icon` (claude `✻`, codex
`◎` by default). `icon` is any string, so plain Unicode, a Nerd Font glyph or
an emoji all work:

```yaml
models:
  codex:
    icon: "🤖"
```

A model with no icon is named instead (`reviewer · codex`), when it is not
the tree's own.

Only `claude` and `codex` are supported. Other CLIs can be added under
`models:`, but resuming their sessions won't work.

An agent resumes its own session by the ID recorded in `agents.yml`. Claude
takes that ID at launch (`new_session_args`). Codex picks its own, so a model
with `session_store: codex` is launched fresh, and supatree then finds the
session that started in the tree root after that launch (the earliest one no
other agent owns) and records its ID. Later opens resume it with
`resume_session_args` (`["resume", "{session_id}"]`), so several Codex agents
can share a tree. Fresh Codex launches in one tree are serialized: a second
agent is refused until the first has written a session record that can be
bound to it. If the first agent never writes one, retry after it starts or
remove that failed agent before launching another.

```yaml
# ~/.config/supatree/config.yml
models:
  codex:
    binary: codex
    resume_session_args: ["resume", "{session_id}"]
    prompt_args: ["{prompt}"]
    session_store: codex
```

#### Setting up Codex

For Codex agents:

1. **Install and log in.** Install the `codex` CLI so it is on `PATH`, then run
   `codex login`.

2. **Install nono's codex package, then re-run `supatree init`.**

   ```sh
   nono pull nolabs-ai/codex && supatree init
   ```

   The package's `codex` profile grants Codex its state (`~/.codex`) and the
   keychain its login lives in. `supatree init` then writes `supatree-codex`
   on top of it, with what every supatree agent gets (toolchain, SSH agent,
   supatree's config read-only, the agent cache). Tree access is still
   granted per launch.

   The package also appends a block to `~/.codex/config.toml` whose first key,
   `developer_instructions`, lands in whatever `[section]` precedes it (TOML
   reads a key as belonging to the last header above it). If Codex then fails
   with `invalid type: string ..., expected u32 in tui.model_availability_nux`
   (or similar), move `developer_instructions` above the first `[...]` header.

   The built-in codex model runs under `supatree-codex` with
   `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --no-daemon`. A `codex` entry
   saved in your `config.yml` before this keeps its own `nono_profile` and
   `args`, so set them:

   ```yaml
   # ~/.config/supatree/config.yml
   models:
     codex:
       nono_profile: supatree-codex
       args: ["--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox", "--no-daemon"]
   ```

   - `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`: nono is the sandbox, and
     Codex's own cannot nest inside it.
   - `--no-daemon`: without it Codex hands its session to the shared
     app-server daemon (the ChatGPT app and earlier `codex` runs start one),
     which runs commands and MCP servers **outside nono** and without the
     agent's `SUPATREE_*` environment.

   The other codex fields (`resume_session_args`, `prompt_args`,
   `session_store`, `icon`) are filled in from the built-in defaults when
   left out.

   Every profile supatree and workbench generate, Claude's included, denies
   that daemon's sockets (`/private/tmp/codex-daemon-<uid>`,
   `~/.codex/app-server-daemon`): on macOS nono lets a sandboxed process
   connect to any Unix socket it can name, and an agent that reaches the
   daemon can have it run commands with your full permissions. A hand-written
   profile must deny them too.

3. **Let Codex's commands see the SSH agent and the sandbox.** Codex builds a
   fresh environment for every command it runs from
   `[shell_environment_policy]` in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Two variables must
   survive it:
   - `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`: without it, `git push` has no agent socket, and ssh falls
     back to reading the private key file, which the sandbox refuses
     (`Load key ...: Operation not permitted`).
   - `NONO_CAP_FILE`: without it, `nono why --self` reports `NOT SANDBOXED`,
     so the agent cannot tell a sandbox denial from any other error.
   - `GOPATH`, when you set one: without it Go falls back to `~/go`, which
     the sandbox does not grant (it grants your `GOPATH`), so nothing builds.
     `GOPRIVATE`/`GONOSUMDB` likewise, for private modules.

   `inherit = "core"` always drops these, since the core set includes none of
   them, even when `include_only` lists them. With a restrictive policy,
   allow what agents need and keep credentials out, e.g.:

   ```toml
   [shell_environment_policy]
   inherit = "all"
   include_only = ["PATH", "HOME", "USER", "SHELL", "TMPDIR", "LANG",
                   "SSH_AUTH_SOCK", "NONO_CAP_FILE", "GO*", "DOCKER_HOST", "SUPATREE*"]
   ```

   `supatree doctor` checks this whenever a codex model is configured.

4. **Register supatree's MCP server with Codex, forwarding supatree's
   environment.** The tools find their tree and agent from `SUPATREE_*`
   variables that supatree sets at launch, but Codex starts MCP servers with
   only a minimal environment. Register the server:

   ```sh
   codex mcp add supatree -- "$(which supatree)" mcp
   ```

   then add `env_vars` to the entry it wrote in `~/.codex/config.toml`
   (`codex mcp add` has no option for it: `--env` only sets fixed values).
   Without it every tree tool answers "Not inside a supatree session":

   ```toml
   # ~/.codex/config.toml
   [mcp_servers.supatree]
   command = "/path/to/supatree"   # written by codex mcp add
   args = ["mcp"]
   env_vars = ["SUPATREE", "SUPATREE_NAME", "SUPATREE_ROOT", "SUPATREE_MEMBERS",
               "SUPATREE_BRANCH_SLUG", "SUPATREE_AGENT", "SUPATREE_MODE",
               "SUPATREE_MEMBER", "SUPATREE_PM", "SUPATREE_PM_NAME"]
   ```

5. **Check it.** In a tree, press `a`, name the agent and pick codex, then ask
   it to call `supatree_info`: it should list the tree's repositories.

## Notifications

`supatree watch` is the single background poller. Each round it refreshes PR status on the shared staleness gate, derives the same summary `supatree status` shows, diffs it against the previous round, appends what changed to the ledger (`~/.local/state/supatree/ledger/events.jsonl`), and delivers the few events that warrant interrupting you as desktop notifications.

`supatree start` spawns one automatically and it exits when the last supatree Zellij session closes. It is a singleton enforced by a file lock, so a second one — a stray `supatree watch`, or a cron entry firing while a session is open — exits quietly rather than doubling the GitHub API load. That makes a scheduled `supatree watch --once` safe to add if you want the hours when no session is running covered too.

Events are a diff, not a report. Nothing that has no previously observed state is announced, so a fresh install and a newly created supatree both stay quiet instead of telling you about everything they can see.

Only two kinds interrupt you: **changes requested** and **checks failing** — the two that mean a human is now waiting on you. Merges, approvals and finished trees are recorded but silent, and pushes and opened PRs only change a sidebar glyph. Repeats of the same news stay quiet for a cooldown (two hours for failing checks, which flap as CI re-runs), and notifications for the supatree whose tab you are currently looking at are suppressed, since you can already see it.

```yaml
# ~/.config/supatree/config.yml
notify_command: ["notify-send", "{title}", "{text}"]   # default: osascript on macOS
watch_interval: 30s                                    # how often to re-derive; the gh fetch behind it stays gated
```

`{title}` and `{text}` are substituted; the values are stripped of quotes and control characters, so a PR title cannot break out of the notifier's own quoting.

In the sidebar, a supatree holding news you have not looked at is marked `!` next to its name; opening it clears the mark. In the dashboard, `e` toggles a recent-activity feed of the same ledger.

## Agents

Opening a root agent also marks the tree root as a trusted folder in `~/.claude.json`, so Claude does not ask "Do you trust the files in this folder?" on every launch. It has to be seeded rather than simply answered once: several agents share the tree root, each rewrites that file wholesale from what it read at startup, and an agent that started before you accepted puts the unaccepted answer back. Only the `hasTrustDialogAccepted` flag for the tree root is touched, only when it is not already set.

All agents run at the supatree root under a nono sandbox that allows the whole tree, its state, and the git directories its commits land in (the stack's and each member's clone) — not other trees, not the PM's queue, not supatree's own state. A member that `sync` adds is not committable by agents already running until they restart: a sandbox's reach is fixed when it starts. `sync` itself is carried out by the watcher, since adding a member writes a clone the agent's sandbox does not reach. Multiple named agents (`--agent`) share the directory but resume independently via cached session IDs. `--repo <alias>` opens an agent scoped to a single member repo instead (the same thing `a` does on a member row in the sidebar).

## MCP tools

`supatree init` registers an MCP server (`claude mcp add supatree -s user -- supatree mcp`) — **run it before your first supatree**, otherwise the supatree PR tools won't appear and you'll only see workbench's own tools. Inside a supatree, the agent gets: `supatree_info`, `sync`, `rename_branches`, `create_pr`, `create_prs` (dependency-ordered), `pr_status`, and `docs`. PR tools refuse to run while the branch slug is still an auto-generated city name, and (unless forced) while a repo's dependencies have no PRs yet. Tools gate on the `SUPATREE` env var, so global registration is safe. New branch slugs (`rename_branches` / `rename-branch`) are lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens, max 40 chars.

The **workbench** MCP tools (`create_pr`, `rename_branch`) are for plain workbench worktrees, not supatrees: inside a supatree they detect `SUPATREE=1` and redirect you to the supatree tools above rather than acting on the wrong branch.
